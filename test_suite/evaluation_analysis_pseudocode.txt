analyze the timeseries data by the following methods:
    Cross-sectional rank skill (IC)
        •	Median IC (robust) + IQR and 5/95% quantiles (tail risk).
        •	%IC > 0 and streaks (longest positive/negative runs).
        •	NW-t of mean(IC) (use your Newey–West): test if mean(IC) > 0.
        •	IR for IC: \text{IR} = \frac{\overline{\text{IC}}}{\text{sd}(\text{IC})}\sqrt{252}.
        •	Fisher z-average (better aggregation):
    z_i=\tfrac12\ln\frac{1+\text{IC}_i}{1-\text{IC}_i}, average with weights w_i\approx n_i-3, then back-transform.

    Classification quality (AUC, LogLoss, Brier)
        •	Median AUC + BCa bootstrap CI (resample days).
        •	Brier decomposition (reliability vs resolution) + ECE (calibration drift) on rolling windows.
        •	Baseline-adjusted hit-rate: report topk_hit_rate − base rate (base ≈ daily % above-median). A raw 0.40 reads differently if the base is 0.35 vs 0.55.

    Portfolio edge (long_short_spread)
        •	Mean daily spread (net), Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, VaR/CVaR (you already compute these).
        •	Deflated Sharpe (optional, guards multiple-testing).
        •	Percentile rank vs random (you already produce): show where your mean sits vs the random distribution median and 5/95% bands.

    How to analyze over time (find when/why it breaks)

    Rolling & change-points
        •	Rolling 60-day IC, AUC, hit-rate with bands; mark change-points (CUSUM or simple threshold on regime shift of rolling mean).
        •	Calendar heatmaps of IC; weekday × hour IC heatmaps (already scaffolded).

    Conditional performance
        •	Market regime: condition on SPX up vs down days; on |SPX| terciles; on cross-sectional dispersion (std of returns across tickers). Report IC/AUC/Spread per bucket.
        •	Sector buckets: daily IC by sector; surface “bad-day book” = worst 10 days with sector contributions.
        •	K-sensitivity: plot spread and hit-rate vs k (5..50). Pick k where edge is most stable.

    Stability & turnover
        •	Rank stability: Kendall-τ / top-k overlap between day t and t−1 (churn hurts costs).
        •	Prediction drift: correlation of today’s scores with yesterday’s. Too low ⇒ unstable; too high ⇒ stale.

    Error anatomy
        •	FP/FN mix aggregated over worst 10% IC days vs best 10%: do you over-long in down markets or over-short in momentum snaps?
        •	Threshold scan (if not pure ranking): Precision–Recall and Youden-J across pooled days to choose a global threshold (if you ever need one).

    Simple regressions (why skill moves)
        •	Regress daily IC (or spread) on: SPX return, |SPX|, VIX change, cross-sectional dispersion, n (coverage), and dummy for event days (FOMC/CPI/quad-witching). Use NW errors. Coefs tell you where the model thrives/fails.

    Visualization shortlist
        •	ECDF/violin for IC/AUC distributions.
        •	Rolling report (small multiples): IC, AUC, spread, hit-rate, with event overlays.
        •	K-sensitivity curve (spread vs k).
        •	Calibration: reliability curve + ECE over time.
        •	Bad-day panel: for the 10 hardest dates—IC, spread, FP/FN, sector heatmap.

    One-liner “report card” you can print
        •	IC: median / 5–95% / %>0 / NW-t.
        •	AUC: median (CI).
        •	Top-k: (hit-rate − base) at chosen k.
        •	Portfolio: mean daily net, Sharpe, max DD, percentile vs random, excess vs S&P.
        •	Stability: τ(top-k overlap).
        •	Regimes: IC when SPX↓ vs SPX↑; low vs high dispersion.
